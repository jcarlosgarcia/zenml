# Environments couple together a deployment with an optional set of
# requirements to be configured on the deployment. The deployment entry
# can be a reference to a global deployment entry by name or an inline
# deployment configuration. Same for the requirements: they can be
# specified either inline using the same format as the global requirements
# file or by referencing a global requirements entry by name.
